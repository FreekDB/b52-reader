 * Classes with multispan GUI table related functionality.

 * License: unknown.
 *
 * This package is based on the MultiSpanCellTableExample class and related classes from Nobuo Tamemasa.
 * Original Java package: jp.gr.java_conf.tame.swing.table
 *
 * In 2008 Andrew Thompson wrote (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.java.gui/WicMvhk1DdM):
 *     "I spent a lot of time researching the possible licensing of the tame Swing codes,
 *      but Nobuo Tamemasa (the author) has proved to be untraceable, and never specified a
 *      license at the time of posting the codes to public forums.  :-("
 *
 * It is also referred to here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21977825/1694043
 *
 *
 * todo: "licensing of the same Swing codes" instead of "licensing of the tame Swing codes"?
